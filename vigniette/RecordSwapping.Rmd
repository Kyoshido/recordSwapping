## Implementation

+ On [https://github.com/sdcTools/recordSwapping](https://github.com/sdcTools/recordSwapping)
+ C++ contained inside dummy-R-Package (src/recordSwap/)
+ R-Code was just used for testing
+ C++ Code does not depend on R installment or any R-Functions
+ C++ Code uses only stl container
    
    + no need (yet?) to use more specialized libraries

## Differences to SAS Code

+ Functionality does differ from original SAS-Code

    + also because the implementation is then more straightforward
